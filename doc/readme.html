eyeBurst Usage Overview
<p>
You must have the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 5.0 installed in order to run
eyeBurst.  It can be <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp">downloaded for free from 
Sun</a> for a number of platforms including Windows and Linux.  On Mac OS X the JRE is
distributed with the standard Software Update from Apple.
<p>
The configuration of eyeBurst is read from the file 'config.properties' in the 'conf'
folder.  The other properties files in the 'conf' folder contain mappings of 
iBurst tower (base station) codes to names of locations per region
for display in eyeBurst.  Which towers properties file is loaded by eyeBurst is 
specified in 'config.properties', and should be set by you according to your location.
<p>
If towers properties file for you region does already not exist in the 'conf' folder 
then you can create your own containing the relevant mappings for your region if you can
obtain this information.  Java properties file format is detailed <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/Properties.html#load(java.io.InputStream)">
here</a>.
Otherwise you can configure eyeBurst to load the file 'empty.towers.properties' which
contains no mappings at all.
<p>
Unfortunately, some network configuration is required to allow eyeBurst to access your iBurst hardware.
The UTD has a fixed IP address of 192.168.250.10 / 24 which must be reachable from the computer on which you run
eyeBurst.  This means that you can run eyeBurst through any number of network indirections, such as 
an ethernet hub, or a wireless access point, or <a href='http://www.blug.linux.no/rfc1149/'>carrier pigeon</a>, provided that your IP configuration is correct.  
For most of us, it should be sufficient to set our computer's network interface IP address to 192.168.250.1, subnet 255.255.255.0 and make
sure that our UTD is connected to the same LAN (or WLAN) as the network interface that we have just configured, which can be as simple as just connecting the UTD directly to
your computer's ethernet socket.  It general you cannot run eyeBurst with the UTD connected to the 'WAN' socket 
of a PPPOE dialer / router device, as it might be when you normally connect to the internet, because the WAN socket
is not in general visible to the internal LAN.  
<p>
Although I have not tested this my understanding is that for UTC devices and devices connected via USB, the iBurst driver, at least on Windows, creates a new network interface specifically for the device.  In this case, you would perform the network configuration described above on this network interface.  You can test your network configuration by opening a telnet session to
192.168.250.10 port 1234 and looking for the UTD prompt that will be displayed if all is well.
<p>
Launch eyeBurst by double-clicking on 'eyeBurst.jar' in the same folder as this
file.  If this shortcut is not supported on your platform you may need to open
a command shell and navigate to the directory where you installed eyeBurst and issue the 
command 'java -jar eyeBurst.jar'.  All eyeBurst logging is written to
stdout.

The use of eyeBurst is entirely at your own risk: the author(s) accept no liability
for any damages incurred as a result of the use of eyeBurst.
