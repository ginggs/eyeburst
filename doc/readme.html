You must have the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 5.0 installed in order to run
eyeBurst.  It can be downloaded for free from <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp">
Sun</a> for a number of platforms including Windows and Linux.  On Mac OS X the JRE is
distributed with the standard Software Update from Apple.
<p>
The configuration of eyeBurst is read from the file 'config.properties' in the 'conf'
folder.  The other properties files in the 'conf' folder contain mappings of 
iBurst tower (base station) codes to names of locations per region
for display in eyeBurst.  Which towers properties file is loaded by eyeBurst is 
specified in 'config.properties', and should be set by you according to your location.
<p>
If towers properties file for you region does already not exist in the 'conf' folder 
then you can create your own containing the relevant mappings for your region if you can
obtain this information.  Java properties files format is detailed <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/Properties.html#load(java.io.InputStream)">
here.
Otherwise you can configure eyeBurst to load the file 'empty.towers.properties' which
contains no mappings at all.
<p>
Launch eyeBurst by double-clicking on 'eyeBurst.jar' in the same folder as this
file.  If this shortcut is not supported on your platform you may need to open
a command shell and navigate to the directory containing this file and issue the 
command 'java -jar eyeBurst.jar'.
